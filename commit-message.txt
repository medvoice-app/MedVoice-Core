feat: optimize MinIO integration with global client and streaming support

This commit significantly improves the MinIO storage integration:

- Added global MinIO client initialization for better performance and connection reuse
- Enhanced storage helpers with streaming download support
- Added direct binary data upload capability (put_object)
- Improved logging with proper logging module
- Created separate endpoint configuration for internal (container) and external (public) access
- Fixed DNS resolution issues by using container name (minio:9000) for internal operations
- Maintained external endpoint (localhost:9000) for public URLs
- Updated all URL generation to use the correct endpoints based on context
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff to all MinIO operations
- Improved Docker service dependencies with explicit conditions
- Added healthcheck for MinIO service
- Added container restart policies for improved reliability
